# Passing UIState from ViewModel to Activity with Kotlin Sealed Classes

This project is used for tutorials on **[U4Universe](https://www.youtube.com/u4universe)** Youtube channel.

# Introduction
As our android app uses MVVM architecture, often times we need to send Commands to our View(Activity) from ViewModel.

We can do this using kotlin enums but there is a limitation with enums. We cannot pass any custom data to View with enums.

Kotlin provide another solution for this ---> SealedClasses

We'll learn

* Create UIState with Sealed Classes
* Send States from ViewModel to Activity
* Update the View according to Ui States
